# Hello-World
My first gh repository

Hello people. My name is David, and I am very interested in learning to code, with microsoft virtual academy, and You-tube's Chris Hawkes. I am interested in learning html5,css3,python,ruby,and finally c#.
I hope to become good enough to perhaps seek out a job coding within 2 years.
